# Used Car Price Predictor


# Aim
This project aims to predict the Price of an used Car by taking it's Company name, it's Model name, Year of Purchase, and Mileage.


# Overview 
In this project we have implemented a regression model to predict the price of used cars according to the parameters: model, mileage, manufacturer, year of purchase, city, state, unique car number on a dataset consists of 8 Lac rows & 8 columns. Our aim was to apply various ML algorithms such as Catboost, XGBoost, RandomForest with Python. Compairing the results & finding most accurate model. Also we have performed ETL using big data technologies. And built a Flask website to serve the model and deployed our model on AWS EC2 . And created Tableau dashboard for data visualization.

The image below shows the flask website.
